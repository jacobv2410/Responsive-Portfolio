   <p>My name is Jacob. I currently work in the construction management industry. 
     I was born and raised in Michigan and moved to California in 2015. 
     Computer Programming is something that I have always wanted to learn and I am glad
    that I finally made the choice to take this class and do so. 
    Tech is something that is very interesting to me and I am always curious how different devices and/or programs work.
     I intend to take my computer programming skills that I am learning and create apps and websites that will change the
      way people interact with certain things on a daily basis.</p>
